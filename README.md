# WhereIsMyCar
Hey everyone! this is a little example in MVP of get current location and show it in a map, saving the data into a local database.

## What we are going to use
- LocationListener (onLocationChanged)
- DBFlow (local database, https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow thank you!)
- Library play services map (Map)
- MVP pattern

## How to use  
It's very simple to use, you just have to save your location when you leave your car in some place. Then you will have the option to load the last location you saved in the database and it will show you in the map!
